# Optional override list of SP16 clause IDs (one per line)
# If this file contains IDs, `npm run extract:sp16` will use them instead of parsing public/sp16.pdf.
#
# Format examples:
# 6
# 6.1
# 6.1.1
# 6.1.1	(you can add a title after whitespace)
# 6.1.1 - any text after id is ignored
#
# Leave this file empty to use automatic PDF extraction.
